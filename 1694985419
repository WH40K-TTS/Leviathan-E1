++ Roster Rules ++

. Synapse: If your Army Faction is TYRANIDS, while a TYRANIDS unit from your army is within 6" of one or more SYNAPSE models from your army, that unit is said to be within Synapse Range of your army. Each time a TYRANIDS unit from your army takes a Battle-shock test, if it is within Synapse Range of your army, take that test on 3D6 instead of 2D6. ()

++ Selection Rules ++

. Anti- Psyker 2+: Weapons with [ANTI-KEYWORD X+] in their profile are known as Anti weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon against a target with the keyword after the word ‘Anti-’, an unmodified Wound roll of ‘x+’ scores a Critical Wound. (10th Edition Core Rules p28)

. Assault: Weapons with [ASSAULT] in their profile are known as Assault weapons. If a unit that Advanced this turn contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn’s Shooting phase. When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its models are equipped with. (10th Edition Core Rules p25)

. Blast: Weapons with [BLAST] in their profile are known as Blast weapons, and they make a random number of attacks. Each time you determine how many attacks are made with a Blast weapon, add 1 to the result for every five models that were in the target unit when you selected it as the target (rounding down). Blast weapons can never be used to make attacks against a unit that is within Engagement Range of one or more units from the attacking model’s army (including its own unit). (10th Edition Core Rules p26)

. Deadly Demise 1: Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6"). (10th Edition Core Rules p23)

. Deadly Demise D6: Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6"). (10th Edition Core Rules p23)

. Deep Strike: During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models. (10th Edition Core Rules p39)

. Devastating Wounds: Weapons with [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] in their profile are known as Devastating Wounds weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if that attack scores a Critical Wound, no saving throw of any kind can be made against that attack (including invulnerable saving throws). Such attacks are only allocated to models after all other attacks made by the attacking unit have been allocated and resolved (10th Edition Core Rules p28)

. Feel No Pain: Some models have 'Feel No Pain x+' listed in their abilities. Each time a model with this ability suffers damage and so would lose a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the number denoted by 'x: that wound is ignored and is not lost. If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, you can only use one of those abilities each time that model
suffers damage and so would lose a wound. (10th Edition Core Rules p23)

. Ignores Cover: Weapons with [IGNORES COVER] in their profile are known as Ignores Cover weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, the target cannot have the Benefit of Cover against that attack. (10th Edition Core Rules p25)

. Leader: While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character model in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit. (10th Edition Core Rules p39)

. Lethal Hits: Weapons with [LETHAL HITS] in their profile are known as Lethal Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically wounds the target. (10th Edition Core Rules p25)

. Shadow in the Warp: If your Army Faction is TYRANIDS, once per battle, in either player’s Command phase, if one or more units from your army with this ability are on the battlefield, you can unleash the Shadow in the Warp. When you do, each enemy unit on the battlefield must take a Battle-shock test. ()

. Synapse: If your Army Faction is TYRANIDS, while a TYRANIDS unit from your army is within 6" of one or more SYNAPSE models from your army, that unit is said to be within Synapse Range of your army. Each time a TYRANIDS unit from your army takes a Battle-shock test, if it is within Synapse Range of your army, take that test on 3D6 instead of 2D6. ()

. Torrent: Weapons with [TORRENT] in their profile are known as Torrent weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, that attack automatically hits the target. (10th Edition Core Rules p25)
